### 1. Installation
The program can be downloaded and opened as a .py file or the code can be copied and pasted into a Python file. The code uses the built-in math library from Python.

### 2. Usage 
* The user selects either 'investment' for investment calculator, or 'bond' for the home loan repayment calculator.
* If the user selects the investment calculator, the user then inputs the amount of money that they are depositing and then the interest rate as a number without the % sign. 
The user then enters the number of years they plan on investing and if they want 'simple' or 'compound' interest. The appropriate amount that they will get back after the given period, at the specified interest rate, is then outputted.
* If the user selects ‘bond’, the user is then prompted to input the present value of the house, the interest rate and the number of months they plan to take to repay the bond.
The program calculates how much money the user will have to repay each month and outputs the answer.
